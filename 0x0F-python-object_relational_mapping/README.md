## About 
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented paradigm in their programming language of choice. In Python, there are several popular ORM libraries, such as SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee, which allow developers to interact with databases using Python objects and methods, rather than writing raw SQL queries. ORM libraries can help simplify database interactions, improve code readability, and reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for common database operations.
